### Who are you guys? 

A bunch of non-nerds from National Institute of Technology, Calicut. We're using this project as a method to learn about quite a few things. Networks, Image Compression and Android Application Development to name a few. 

### Okay, cool. How are you going to do that? 

Well, we thought let's combine all the three together! Seriously though, that's what we'll be doing. We aim to initially conduct a study of the existing image compression algorithms and compare the compression ratios of them using a standard image. We would then implement the algorithm and use the same to convert images on a devices storage to a smaller size without any perceptible loss in quality. This image of a smaller size would then be sent over to another device over a Wi-Fi network, thus enabling faster transfer times.

### That's a lot of stuff going on. 

So here's a short, succinct version of what's going on :  
"To implement a peer-to-peer image sharing application that uses an optimal compression algorithm to send compressed image files over an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network."

Yep, **that is** what we will do.
